This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed
The output of the program should be:  
The number, followed by
- if the number is greater than 0: is positive
- if the number is 0: is zero
- if the number is less than 0: is negative

This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by n, followed by the string is, followed by:
- if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
- if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0
